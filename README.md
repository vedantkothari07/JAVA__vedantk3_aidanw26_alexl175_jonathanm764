# RSObesity by JAVA
# Roster:
**PM:** Vedant Kothari

**Graph Lead:** Aidan Wong

**Middleware Lead:** Alex Luo

**Database Lead:** Jonathan Metzler

# Project Description:

Over time, obesity has become a serious issue, especially in the United States. In fact, since 1975, global obesity rates have nearly tripled. To spread awareness, we created a website that extrapolates information from various datasets to graph and visualize obesity by location, physical composition, and cases of death from obesity. In addition, our site analyzes previous cases of obesity to warn people and improve their quality of life by providing lifestyle change advice to avoid obesity. 

# Install Guide

**Prerequisites**

Ensure that **Git** and **Python** are installed on your machine. It is recommended that you use a virtual machine when running this project to avoid any possible conflicts. For help, refer to the following documentation:
   1. Installing Git: https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git 
   2. Installing Python: https://www.python.org/downloads/ 

   3. (Optional) Setting up Git with SSH (Ms. Novillo's APCSA Guide): https://novillo-cs.github.io/apcsa/tools/ 
         

**Cloning the Project**
1. Create Python virtual environment:

```
$ python3 -m PATH/TO/venv_name
```

2. Activate virtual environment 

   - Linux: `$ . PATH/TO/venv_name/bin/activate`
   - Windows (PowerShell): `> . .\PATH\TO\venv_name\Scripts\activate`
   - Windows (Command Prompt): `>PATH\TO\venv_name\Scripts\activate`
   - macOS: `$ source PATH/TO/venv_name/bin/activate`

   *Notes*

   - If successful, command line will display name of virtual environment: `(venv_name) $ `

   - To close a virtual environment, simply type `$ deactivate` in the terminal


3. In terminal, clone the repository to your local machine: 

HTTPS METHOD (Recommended)

```
$ git clone https://github.com/vedantkothari07/JAVA__vedantk3_aidanw26_alexl175_jonathanm764.git     
```

SSH METHOD (Requires SSH Key to be set up):

```
$ git clone git@github.com:vedantkothari07/JAVA__vedantk3_aidanw26_alexl175_jonathanm764.git
```

4. Navigate to project directory

```
$ cd PATH/TO/JAVA__vedantk3_aidanw26_alexl175_jonathanm764/
```

5. Install dependencies

```
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```
        
# Launch Codes
